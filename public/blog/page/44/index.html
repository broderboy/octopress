  <div class="entry-content"><p>I got some time today on the train today to listen to Episode 8 of the Google Developer Podcast.  Normally I&#8217;ll listen to it at work when it first comes out but it&#8217;s been way to hectic.  Here are some highlights some commentary thrown in.<br /><br /></p>

<ul>
<li>ZohoWriter goes on Gears - See my opinions about this <a href="http://gpowered.blogspot.com/2007/08/google-get-in-gear.html">here</a>.  Google really needs to step it up and get Gears into their own services.  The top two on my list being Gmail and Docs</li>
<li>Embed Google Maps in a &#8220;youtube like way&#8221;.  Also the Drag zoom and custom marker manager controls have been improved.  Very easy to use.</li>
<li>Sky in Google Earth.  I havn&#8217;t played with this yet.  I&#8217;ll check it out after work tomorrow if Halo 3 isn&#8217;t in the mailbox ;-)
<ul><li>Stars</li>
<li>Google&#8217;s proof that there probably is life on other planets: Earth is not just a &#8220;one off&#8221;.</li>
<li>We need a Marvin the Martian Easter egg</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Google Objective-C library has been updated for code search, Picasa, and calendar</li>
</ul>


<p>The Guest in this episode was Mark Stahl, the Tech lead of GData since it started (about 2 1/2 years)</p>

<ul>
<li>GData is the way to interact with Google Data, See most of my <a href="http://gpowered.blogspot.com/search/label/HOWTO">HOWTO&#8217;s</a> for examples.</li>
<li>Uses the Atom publishing protocol (REST)</li>
<li>Resources are represented as XML.  Many, many libraries are out there for working with XML so no steep learning curve for working with the data.</li>
<li>GET, PUT, POST, DEL to manipulate Data</li>
<li>A feed is a container of Data Items</li>
<li>Atom: syndication technology.  It is a feed document.  Used as a response for &#8220;get me the latest version of&#8230;. foofoo data set</li>
<li>Atom publishing protocol added manipulation in the form of read/write</li>
<li>Atom beat out RSS because it already had an ITEF committee</li>
<li>GData builds on top of Atom publishing
<ul>
<li>Way to query, by passing parameters through a URL</li>
<li>Standardized parameters</li>
</ul>
</li><li>Atom has no concurrency to detect conflicts / multiple writes</li>
<li>Etags are coming in the future to address this.  Etags are strings that contain version info.  This will enable for better caching solutions on the client, or any point in between the client and the server.</li>
<li>
</li><li>The GData team chose REST because the web is built on REST ideas.  It already had developer Acceptability.  It&#8217;s also easy to learn. </li>
<li>REST is a style, its good at certain things, but has trouble mapping certain operations that would perhaps be better off as an RPC</li>
<li>Atomic but not transactional</li>
<li>The first service to get GData was Calendar, and it currently gets the most request, followed (in order) by Blogger, Base, and Spreadsheets.</li>
<li>The most popular client libraries are the ones in Java and .net, followed by Python, PHP, Objective C, Lisp, and Ruby</li>
<li>Authentication can be done via ClientLogin with a token (Programmatic login), or via authsub (Google handles credentials)</li>
<li>Uses &#8220;kinds&#8221;: Semantic level syndication (add custom info to an entry and helps define types of entries)</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Do you want the GDrive?  I know I do.  Rumors have been flying around for almost 2 years about this thing, its been the brunt of an April Fool&#8217;s joke, complete with official announcement and a Google Group (see below).  Googlers use it, and if it ever comes out, it would change the way both home and corporate users think about file storage.  Google is almost there, almost.  When they integrate Gears into Docs they&#8217;ll be one step closer.  They would just need a few more features on the main Docs UI (bulk file upload, share files right from there instead of having to publish from within the document) and allow for any file type. <br /><br /></p>

<p><img src="http://lh3.google.com/timothy.broder/RvHFzfREi8I/AAAAAAAAMSI/87CkGvBuJLI/s400/plat1.jpg?imgdl=1" border=1/><br /><br /></p>

<p>Quick recap of the internal GDrive / Platypus client:<br />
Backup: if your computer goes down, catches on fire, or just plain old BSOD&#8217;s, just get a new computer, install the platypus client, and your files <br />will be on the new system before you know it
You can sync across multiple computers.  Great if you have multiple buildings, cubes, or a laptop floating around<br />
VPN-less access<br />
Disconnect Access.  Google Gears anyone?<br />
Other users can just mount your shares on their filesystem<br />
FAST<br /><br /></p>

<p>I took some time and went through similar offerings that are currently available<br /><br />
<b>
<a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3">Amazon S3</a></b></p>

<ul>
<li>uses Amazon account (just have to enable as a web service)</li>
<li>$.15 per gig</li>
<li>programmatic way to store files.  No UI on Amazon&#8217;s site</li>
</ul>

<ul>

</ul>


<br />


<p><b>Microsoft Skydrive</b><br />
Pros</p>

<ul>

<li>Only 500 MB</li>
<li>50 MB Max file size</li>
</ul>

<br /><br />


<p>Overall I think I would have to go with Box.net.  It was really smooth.  Had some good features and it was really easy to upload files.  the free 5 gigs wasn&#8217;t too bad either.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Blogger, good.  FeedBurner, good.  Google Webmaster tools, good.  The 3 working together? A little more difficult.  A few months ago blogger <a href="http://buzz.blogger.com/2007/07/attention-FeedBurner-fans.html">added support</a> to have FeedBurner + blogger integration.  No more editing template code, just change a setting in blogger, and viola, FeedBurner will track all your subscribers.  However, this method did not go over so well with Google Webmaster Tools.  Previously you could just add your blog&#8217;s feed as a sitemap for you blog and the Google Bot would have no problem.  If you turned on FeedBurner however, sitemap errors popped up all over because the FeedBurner links were on a different domain from the blog, etc..<br /><br /></p>

<p>Here is a way to make it work (assuming you already have a blog set up):<br /><br /></p>

<ol>
<li>Make an account on <a href="http://www.FeedBurner.com/fb/a/home">FeedBurner</a> and add your blog to it<br /><br />
<img src="http://lh6.google.com/timothy.broder/RvE7pPREi1I/AAAAAAAAMRQ/rgAU_migW2A/s400/feedburne.jpg?imgdl=1" border=1/><br /><br /></li>

<li>Then, in blogger go to settings > Site Feed > Post Feed Redirect URL and add your FeedBurner feed<br /><br />
<img src="http://lh6.google.com/timothy.broder/RvE7pPREi2I/AAAAAAAAMRY/yy7Obs753HM/s400/FeedBurner2.jpg?imgdl=1" border=1/><br /><br /></li>

<li>Finally, if you want to track your blog in <a href="www.google.com/webmasters/sitemaps/">Google Webmaster Tools</a> you will have to add the sitemap a little differently then normal.  Add a General Web sitemap as the &#8220;rss.xml?orderby=updated&#8221; feed off of your blog.  FeedBurner does not pick up this feed in the redirects, so the Google Bot will not have trouble with it.<br /><br />
<img src="http://lh3.google.com/timothy.broder/RvE7pfREi3I/AAAAAAAAMRg/s_PLXzrV9hE/s400/FeedBurner3.jpg?imgdl=1" border=1/><br /><br /></li>
<li>After this your site will be tracked by FeedBurner as well as Google Webmaster tools and the Google Bot will be able to use the sitemap properly<br /><br /></li>
</ol>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I love to read.  I always have and I probably always will.  When people ask me why I read so much or about how fast I can, I usually attest to the fact that when I was a child, the household rule was no television on weekdays, so, lots of books and reading.  I still remember the first book I was able to finish on my own without any help from my mother; The Mouse and the Motorcycle.<br /><br /></p>

<p>A few months ago when I was looking for a service to keep track of all my books (those I had read and those I wanted), the top two that I had come up with were <a href="http://www.shelfari.com/">Shelfari</a> and <a href="http://www.librarything.com/">LibraryThing</a>.  At the time LibraryThing seemed slow and clunky while Shelfari came off as fairly polished.  Note that I really didnt spend too much time at either during this initial assessment and that I ended up going with Shelfari.<br /><br /></p>

<p>Coming back to the present, I still use Shelfari and now that <a href="http://books.google.com/">Google Book search</a> has come out with the <a href="http://books.google.com/googlebooks/mylibrary/">My Library</a> feature, its time to do an assessment of this decision. <br /><br /></p>

<p><b>My Library</b><br /></p>

<p>Launched on September 6th, this is the latest feature of Google Book Search.  Normally I just go to Amazon if Im looking for a book, but thats more likely because thats what I am used to.  Check out my test Library <a href="http://books.google.com/books?as_list=BDYjGJ9gQiI2fwZ2RhK_5ARoUEnPi_37Mmen-Zjyn9rNza5Y7yew&hl=en">here</a><br /><br />
<img src="http://lh6.google.com/timothy.broder/RvCD9fREiyI/AAAAAAAAMQ4/Rm4fglWiqd4/s400/mylibrary.jpg?imgdl=1" border=1/><br /><br />
Pros<br /></p>

<ul>
<li>Search doesnt always return what I want.  Sometimes I had to go find the ISBN and use that</li>
<li>Very fast searching</li>
<li>Once books are added to the library, you can search the text within those books and get a preview</li>
<li>Has List view and cover view.  The list view has a link to Add Labels, Write a Review, and More Editions</li>
<li>Links to buy the book from Amazon, Barns & Noble, Booksense, or Froogle</li>
<li>Can look for the book in a library</li>
<li>Reviews from all over the internet (shows 10)</li>
<li>References from all over the internet (shows 10)</li>
<li>References from other books</li>
<li>Links to other editions</li>
<li>References from scholarly works</li>
<li>Can share list as an RSS feed</li>
<li>No need to sign up if you already have a Google account</li>
<li>Unlimited books</li></ul>


<br />


<p>Cons<br /></p>

<ul>
<li>limited preview, I know other services dont even offer a preview, but its such a tease</li>
<li>The library didnt seem to be finding good results.  I looked up a few books that I know are in the library up the street and it wasnt finding them.</li>
<li>No user reviews</li>
<li>Only export format is RSS</li>
<li>Can only import by ISBN by typing a list or copy/paste</li>
<li>Need a Google account</li></ul>


<br /> 


<p><b>LibraryThing</b><br />
I had initially been turned off by this one because the UI seemed clunky and was sluggish when I first tested it out.  A lot of this has changed.  Check out my test library <a href="http://www.librarything.com/catalog/broderboy">here</a><br /><br />
<img src="http://lh6.google.com/timothy.broder/RvCD9fREizI/AAAAAAAAMRA/rPQTBXANWPg/s400/librarything.jpg?imgdl=1" border=1/><br /><br />
Pros<br /></p>

<ul>
<li>If you really like Amazon (me), then using that as the database is a pro</li>
<li>Good recommendations.  The recommendations were pretty spot on.  There are books on the list that I have been meaning to read for a while now (that I have not yet added)</li>
<li>Lots of Find At (buy) options: Abebooks, Alibris, Amazon, Barnes & Noble, BookFinder, BookSense, Worldcat, and more</li>
<li>The size differences and bolding in the tag cloud make it pretty easy to spot trends</li>
<li>Reviews by users</li>
<li>I love the book swapping links</li>
<li>Good rating system (out of 5)</li>
<li>Links to related Wikipedia articles</li>
<li>Lots of options for blog cloud</li>
<li>Can link with other social sites: Facebook, Digg, etc</li></ul>


<br />


<p>Cons<br /></p>

<ul>
<li>only searches Amazon of the Library of congress</li>
<li>You can only save 200 books.  Lame.  They charge $10/year or $25/lifetime to store unlimited books</li>
<li>The Display styles of A, B, C, D, E are confusing if you dont go look up what they mean</li>
<li>The click on cover menu takes a little while to get used to</li>
<li>Blog cloud is static</li>
<li>Has a lot of social aspects, but no Friends</li></ul>

Pros<br /></p>

<ul>
<li>Multiple shelves</li>
<li>Friends and groups, seems more social then the other two.  (LibraryThing links to social aspects, but doesnt have them as built in as Shelfari)</li>
<li>Quite pretty</li>
<li>Member reviews and Amazon reviews (linked separately)</li>
<li>Can write notes (different from reviews) about each book or a shelf in general</li></ul>


<br />


<p>Cons<br /></p>

<ul>
<li>Requires Flash</li>
<li>Can only buy from Amazon</li>
<li>Tag cloud doesnt have enough difference in size</li>
<li>Ads at the bottom of each page</li>
<li>Has social aspect of friends, but doesnt reach out to other social sites</li></ul>

<p>All in all I think I may stick with Shelfari.  Yes My Library was the fastest for searching, and did relate the books to the most external sources, but sometimes it took a little longer to find the book I was looking for in the list.  My searches in Shelfari, while slower always had the book I wanted in the top 3 results.  I really like the recommendation and book swapping features of LibraryThing.  What sold me on Shelfari and continues to do so, is the multiple shelves.  I have a shelf for books I own and have read, a shelf for books I own but have not read, and a shelf for books I would like to buy.  I just really like breaking it up this way.  The only thing that could make this aspect better, would be if I could like my third list to my Amazon wish list.</p>

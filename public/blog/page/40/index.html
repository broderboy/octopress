  <div class="entry-content"><p>First, <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/10/14/top-blogs-on-google-reader/">Techcrunch</a> came up with a list of the top blogs that users subscribe to using Google Reader. The top 3 on the list were BBC with 202,463, Google News wih 192,100, and ESPN with 189,274 .  Remember, these are only the stats if the subscriber is using Google Reader, obviously there are blogs with a higher subscription count, such as the <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/">Official Google Blog</a> (They still haven&#8217;t moved over to blogs.google.com eh?) with over 669,000 subscribers as reported by FeedBurner.</p>

<br /><br />


<p>It was all well and good that Google Reader showed high stats for these blogs, but&#8230;. we were apparently duped&#8230;<br /><br /></p>

<p>In his article <a href="http://mashable.com/2007/10/15/google-reader-stats-are-bullshit-with-proof/">Google Reader Stats are BullSh*t (With Proof)</a>, Pete Cashmore goes into his explanation of the &#8220;default feed effect.&#8221;  A default feed is a feed that comes already subscribed in a news aggregator  , or is part of a default group (like say Digg, Engadget, and Gizmodo being in the Technology group on Google Reader).  Being in these groups is a major traffic boost.<br /><br /></p>

<p>However the system has some flaws</p>

<ul><li>There is subscription data for feeds that don&#8217;t exist</li><li>
Google Reader does not check to see if a subscriber is active or not.  (Someone signs up for Reader, adds a feed, and never touches Reader again, they count as a subscriber)</li><li>
Feedburner pulls some stats from Google Reader</li><li>
This problem is not limited to Google Reader.  It includes many feed readers and start pages</li></ul>


<br /><br />


<p>Tune in next time after I do some research into how out wack FeedBurner statistics are.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After doing quite a bit of reading over at Yaro Starak&#8217;s <a href="http://www.entrepreneurs-journey.com/">Entrepreneur&#8217;s Journey</a> and Darren Rowse&#8217;s <a href="http://problogger.net">ProBlogger.net</a> I&#8217;ve decided to move gPowered onto my domain at <a href="http://blog.gpowered.net/">http://blog.gpowered.net/</a>. <br /><br />Over the coming days/weeks I&#8217;ll be updating the template on the rest of the domain to coincide more with the blog, as well as adding the top menu to the blog.  The blog is still powered by blogger and the old address nicely forwards to the new one, posts included.  I also updated the <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/gPpowered">FeedBurner feed</a> so if you use that to subscribe you shouldn&#8217;t have to change anything (although with the forwarding I don&#8217;t think it matters, but why risk it).  I also set up gpowered.net and www.gpowered.net to forward to the blog as the main page.  Any of my python examples will be moved from http://gpowered.net to http://gpowered.net/g/.  I&#8217;m going to update all of the posts to reflect this.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s been a little more then a week&#8230; Chalk it up to quite a bit of traveling. I&#8217;m around now until December, I promise ;)<br /><br /></p>

<p><b>This weeks winner: <a href="http://www.mappington.com">Mappington</a><br /></b>
API&#8217;s used:</p>

<ul><li><a href="http://api.eventful.com/">Eventful</a></li><li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/services/">Flickr</a></li><li><a href="http://www.geonames.org/export/">GeoNames</a></li><li><a href="http://www.google.com/apis/maps/">Google Maps</a></li><li><a href="http://developer.kayak.com/">Kayak</a></li><li><a href="http://dev.live.com/virtualearth">Microsoft Virtual Earth</a></li><li><a href="http://technorati.com/developers/">Technorati</a></li><li><a href="http://www.weather.com/services/xmloap.html">Weather Channel</a></li><li><a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/answers">Yahoo Answers</a></li><li><a href="http://developer.yahoo.net/search/local/">Yahoo Local Search</a></li><li><a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/maps/">Yahoo Maps</a></li><li><a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/traffic/index.html">Yahoo Traffic</a></li><li><a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/travel/">Yahoo Travel</a></li><li><a href="http://code.google.com/apis/youtube/overview.html">YouTube</a></li></ul>


<p>Why it won:  Mappington is the most inclusive map / location information hub I have ever come across.  &#8220;Mappington is a user created atlas of the world.&#8221;  It covers the following:<br /></p>

<ul><li>Maps: Google Maps, Virtual Earth, Yahoo Maps, Google Earth</li><li>
Photos: Flickr</li><li>
Videos: Youtube</li><li>
Wikipedia Entries</li><li>
Opinions / Rating section</li><li>
Social Web on Wikipedia, Facebook, del.icio.us, furl, Yahoo MyWeb, Wink, ma.gnolia, spurl</li><li>
Discussions</li><li>
History</li><li>
News: Yahoo News</li><li>
Blog: Google Blog Search, Technorati</li><li>
Hotels</li><li>
Flights</li><li>
Weather: Weatherbug</li><li>
Events: e:vene</li><li>
Trips: Yahoo Travel</li></ul>


<br />


<p>The layout is crisp, clean, and easy on the eyes.  There are minimal load times and Mappington makes good use of Ajax.  If you are planning a trip or just want to explore new places, Mappington is the best place to do it.  I&#8217;m definitely going to use it to plan out my trip to Ireland in a few months. <br /><br /></p>

<p>What I think it could improve on:<ul><li>
The video&#8217;s don&#8217;t show that you can click on them (mouse pointer does not change)</li><li>
The photos should tap into Picasa Web also</li><li>
In the News section, it looked like there was supposed to be a left frame (Google News maybe?) but it never loaded</li><li>
I wish you could blow the map up full screen</li><li>
The thumbnail view in Google Maps wasn&#8217;t working</li><li>
Mappington should build some widgets / gadgets to get more exposure on personal web pages and sites like myspace</li></ul><br /><br /></p>

<p><b>Runner Ups</b><br /><br />
<a href="http://www.windsurfingclips.com/">Wind Surfing Clips</a><br /></p>

<ul><li>API&#8217;s: youtube</li><li>
Clean interface</li><li>
For such exciting and energetic video&#8217;s, the template is pretty bland</li><li>
I&#8217;d like a link to the original video on youtube</li></ul>


<br /><br />


<p><a href="http://www.babynamemap.com/">Baby Name Map</a><br /></p>

<ul><li>API&#8217;s: Google Maps</li><li>
Very fitting interface</li><li>
Maps are slow</li><li>
The Javascript pop-up UI feels very out of place compared to the site&#8217;s theme</li></ul>


<br /><br />


<p><a href="http://www.mynextdive.com/">My Next Dive</a><br /></p>

<ul><li>API&#8217;s: Google Maps</li><li>
The popup on the main page won&#8217;t go away</li></ul>


<br /><br />


<p><a href="http://www.mymapchat.com/">My Map Chat</a><br /></p>

<ul><li>API&#8217;s: Google Maps</li><li>
Global shout outs are very entertaining</li></ul>


<br /><br />


<p><a href="http://www.zoogle.in/">Zoogle</a><br /></p>

<ul><li>API&#8217;s: Amazon eCommerce, CNET, del.icio.us, Digg, eBay, Flickr, Google Search, Windows Live Search, Yahoo Search, YouTube</li><li>
The search box doesn&#8217;t understand spaces?!? Ex: I put in &#8220;Tim Broder&#8221; it returned nothing and asked me if I meant &#8220;Tim+Broder&#8221; which returned some results that I expected</li></ul>


<br /><br />


<p><a href="http://www.croatia-map.net/">Croatia-Map.net</a></p>

<ul><li>API&#8217;s: Google Maps</li><li>
Very smooth, clean, well done</li></ul>

<p><a href="http://www.cadoogle.com/">CADoogle</a><br />
Demonstrates Autodesk Freewheel. Allows you to search, preview, and download publicly available CAD files indexed by Google. It is free to use and leverages Google Search and Autodesk Freewheel Web services.<br /></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you haven&#8217;t heard about <a href="http://www.overheardinnewyork.com">Overheard in New York</a> ( OHNY ), or don&#8217;t subscribe to it, I can&#8217;t recommend it more.  It&#8217;s absolutely hilarious.  It&#8217;s been around for a while and is constantly updated with a dozen or so quotes a day that people hear while walking / riding around New York City.  You don&#8217;t have to live in the city to enjoy it, though you might not get all of the humor.  I used <a href="http://gpowered.blogspot.com/2007/09/google-reader-adds-search-box.html">Google Reader Search</a> to go through the feed looking for Google references.  Here are a few, note: there were a lot more but not all were appropriate for all audiences.<br /><br /></p>

Female Google suit: How&#8217;s your son doing?<br />

Female Google suit: I&#8217;d love to see some pictures sometime!<br />

<p><b>But Which One? Which One?</b><br />
Crazy guy: Can anyone tell me about the Chinese stock market? [Two minutes later] Can anyone tell me about the Chinese stock market? Come on, people, that&#8217;s an easy question!<br />
Suit, laughing: Here&#8217;s an easy question for you: How far away is Saturn to Pluto?<br />
Crazy guy: That is too easy. Why would you ask me something so easy? The answer is Google. Google is the answer. The real question is, are there aliens from Saturn and Pluto on this train right now? And how could you tell the difference? [Looks around, waits for an answer.] Well, I know, because I&#8217;m one of them! [Crazy guy gets off the train.]<br />

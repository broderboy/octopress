  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of my friends at work asked me today how I sift through volumes of news to find articles and information on Google and specifically on Google Code for my articles.  The answer is simple, I don&#8217;t.  Granted, I DO read a LOT, but there just aren&#8217;t enough hours in the day to read everything I want to.  So, I have a <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/">Yahoo Pipe</a> sift through the feeds for me.  Pipes is &#8220;a powerful composition tool to aggregate, manipulate, and mashup content from around the web.&#8221;  Its fairly easy to use and doesn&#8217;t require any code or coding experience, although understanding the basic layout of an RSS or Atom feed is a definite plus.  The method I&#8217;m going to describe could work for any blogger or anyone who wants to filter a single or large group of feeds by keyword.  I&#8217;m not going to go into the details of Yahoo Pipes, there are plenty of tutorials and examples for that.  I&#8217;m just going to describe how I built the small pipe I use to filter for Google news.<br /><br /></p>

<p>The first step is to log into or create a Yahoo account and go to <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/">http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/</a> and click on Create Pipe.  The first node we&#8217;re going to use is under sources and is called &#8220;Fetch Feed&#8221;.  Add as many of these as you want to pull in all the feeds you will need. <br /><br />
<img src="http://lh6.google.com/timothy.broder/RwQeq2uGXrI/AAAAAAAAMTE/_APNQgTsUMQ/s400/pipe1.jpg?imgdl=1" border=1/></p>

<br /><br /> 


<p>Then use unions (located under Operators) to join these Fetches together.  If you have more then 5 feeds, you will need multiple unions.</p>

<br /><br />




<br /><br /><img src="http://lh6.google.com/timothy.broder/RwQeq2uGXsI/AAAAAAAAMTM/uKp3MSfdtUg/s400/pipe2.jpg?imgdl=1" border=1/> <br /><br />


<p>Finally, add a filter, also located under Operators.  Here, &#8220;Permit&#8221; items that match &#8220;any&#8221; of the following.  Then, add rules where item.description > Contains and then the word or phrase you want to search for.  This filter will allow any posts that have the words through, and block everything else.  Send the output of the Filter to the Pipe Output and you are done.</p>

<br /><br />


<p><img src="http://lh6.google.com/timothy.broder/RwQeq2uGXtI/AAAAAAAAMTU/zrI8IloMhiw/s400/pipe3.jpg?imgdl=1" border=1/><br /><br /></p>

<p>You can then subscribe to the output of this pipe with the reader of your choice.  When I subscribe to my pipe&#8217;s <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.run?_id=vF35LapU3BG9UzFodbq02Q&_render=rss">feed</a> in Google Reader, I only see posts that contain the word Google or google.  I also could have done that as one filter with a regular expression, or just with &#8220;oogle&#8221;.</p>

<br /><br />

  <div class="entry-content"><p>ProBlogger&#8217;s Birthday is <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2007/10/02/54000-worth-of-prizes-on-offer-in-the-problogger-birthday-bash-competitions/">here</a> and Darren is running small contests throughout the week with over $54,000 in prizes. I missed the first few, thank you work and being on call, but the prizes have been pretty good so far.</p>

<br /><br />


<p>The first contest was for copies of Aaron Walls <a href="http://www.seobook.com/">SEO Book</a> and all you had to do was comment on the post announcing the contest. The second set of prizes were free listings on <a href="http://www.seekzap.com/">SeekZap</a> and all you had to do was sign up! (This is the one I&#8217;m really bummed about missing.) The final prize for yesterday for the first 25 responders was tubes of Mederma scar treatment. For the full prize list, see <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ProbloggerHelpingBloggersEarnMoney/~3/164167517/">here</a></p>

<br /><br />


<p>You don&#8217;t have to have a blog to participate in most of the competitions so if you want to have some fun over the next few days, and into the weekend (this is actually pretty good for me, I&#8217;m stuck home on call, now I&#8217;ll have something to do ;), add the feed to your reader and try to keep up.<br /><br />
Note: The current contest is for <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2007/10/03/win-two-lg-usb-monitors-from-displaylink-giveaway/">2 20? LG USB monitors</a><br /><br />
Good luck to all!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Its definitely been a busy month for Google Apps with the launch of presentations (finally).  As a result, there is a new <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=eRqUE6IHTEA">video</a> as well as an updated <a href="http://www.google.com/google-d-s/tour1.html">tour</a>.  There is no API available yet but as soon as it comes out I&#8217;ll post a HOWTO.<br /><br /></p>

<p>Spreadsheets added <a href="http://docs.google.com/support/spreadsheets/bin/answer.py?answer=75507&query=googlereader&topic=&type=">new ways</a> to pull external data.  The external sources can include XML, a URL, HTML, or any feed based file. Spreadsheets also added autofill (type Dec and it can autofill December.  Type Jan, Feb, Mar, and it will fill in the rest of the months for you.  This also works with days of the week, time, and more)<br /><br /></p>

<p>The Reporting API was release into Google Apps Premier, Education, and Partner editions.  This allows users to see detailed reports on how people in their organization are using Google Apps.  They can track account activity, disk space, email client usage, and more.<br /><br /></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Or at least to London? A VW bug with a camera attached to the top has been spotted in London. Could be <a href="http://maps.google.com/help/maps/streetview/index.html">Google</a>? Maybe expanding to areas around their <a href="http://googlified.com/2007is-there-a-google-office-near-you/">offices</a> in other countries? Nothing has been confirmed yet. <br /><br />I think this could pick up if Google started going to major Global Cities. Think about it, you could go site seeing without ever leaving your desk. The top cities on my list would be London, Tokyo, Paris, Venice, Dublin, and Hong Kong. I am hopefully going to two of these in the next 6 months (Tokyo and London) around the holidays.  Although, Google might have some <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/06/05/google_street_view_legality_in_europe/">legal hoops</a> to jump through if they decide to do this.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Most of my friends got the reference to the &#8220;By the Power of Google&#8221; tagline that I chose to use for gPowered.  Being a child of the 80&#8217;s I had the privilege to watch some of the greatest cartoons ever created.  One of those, was He-Man where one of the popular lines is &#8220;BY THE POWER OF GRAYSKULL.&#8221;  When I was throwing around taglines with &#8220;powered by&#8221; (powered by Google), He-Man&#8217;s line kept popping into my head and stuck.  If you don&#8217;t know what He-Man is, check out the short summery from wikipedia.<br /><br /></p>

<p><i>The show takes place on the fictional planet of Eternia, a land of magic, myth and fantasy. The show&#8217;s lead character is Prince Adam, the young son of Eternia&#8217;s rulers, King Randor and Queen Marlena. Prince Adam is a seemingly cowardly, blond muscleman dressed in a Cote d&#8217;Azur chemise. However, Prince Adam possesses a magic sword, and when he holds it aloft and says the magic words &#8220;By the Power of Grayskull! I have the Power!&#8221; he is transformed into He-Man, the most powerful man in the universe. He-Man is a brave, blond muscleman in a baldric and loincloth. Together with his close allies, Battle Cat, Teela, Man-At-Arms and Orko, He-Man uses his powers to defend Eternia from the evil forces of Skeletor, a tyrannical warlord with a skull for a face. Skeletor&#8217;s main goal is to conquer the mysterious fortress of Castle Grayskull, from which He-Man draws his powers. If he succeeds, Skeletor would be able to conquer not only Eternia, but the whole universe.</i> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/He-Man_and_the_Masters_of_the_Universe">wikipedia</a>)<br /><br /></p>

<p>And now for a blast from the past, here is the opening theme complete with the famous lines.<br /><br /></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>from the work blog:<br /><br /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.alexanderinteractive.com/blog/2009/11/take-your-batch-into-the-cloud.html">Take your batch into the cloud</a>: &#8221;<p>About a year ago I wrote a webapp called <a href="http://twitter2gtalk.appspot.com">twitter2gtalk</a>, which simply takes your latest Twitter message and sets it as your Google <a href="http://www.google.com/talk/">Talk </a>Status.  Shortly there after I attended an <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/">App Engine</a> Hackathon (GAE) at Google NYC.  At the hackathon, I started porting the app over to app engine.  At the time, there was no scheduling or cron support in GAE.  I created a hybrid app running between GAE and my webfaction server.  My webfaction server would handle the cron, proxy out the requests, and do some of the longer running tasks (the limit on an app engine request is 20 seconds).<br />
 <br />
Now with the release of the <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/config/cron.html">Task Scheduler</a> and <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/taskqueue/">Task Queues</a>, you can break up a long winded process into the cloud.  My batch was taking around 18 minutes to run, with about 800 users being processed each time.  For each user the app had to get their Twitter status, then connect to Google&#8217;s xmpp server, and after a couple of xmpp calls, update the Google Talk Status.  Even being single threaded, this whole process started eating up a lot of juice on the server.  The rest of my apache processes suffered and the entire site slowed down<br />
 <br />
Using the new app engine features, I was able to do two things: 1) Move the scheduling into app engine itself and 2) have app engine do the bulk of the work, by having each user-update be its own task.  These worker tasks are then processed anywhere in the cloud, and can be run in parallel, independently of each other</p></p>

<p>The original code was something like:<br />
     <br />
for users in all my users:<br />
        get twitter status<br />
        connect to gtalk<br />
        get current status<br />
        update status</p>




<p> My process for converting this to app engine tasks was as follows:<br />
1) Create a process to load all of the users into a Task Queue<br />
2) Set up each Task Queue so that it can independently do the work for the user that it is associated with<br />
3) Schedule Step 1 to run every half hour<br />
 <br />
Skeleton Code for Step 1:</p>




<p>class TaskLoader(BaseRequestHandler):  </p>




<p>def get(self):  <br />
logging.info(&quot;Starting to load tasks %s&quot; % datetime.datetime.now())  </p>




<p>users = Account.gql(&#39;WHERE active = :1&#39;, True)  <br />
 <br />
count = 0  <br />
for user in users:  </p>




<p>send_key = # data to send to the worker  <br />
taskqueue.add(url=&#39;/worker/&#39;, params={&#39;key&#39;: send_key})  </p>




<p>count += 1  <br />
         <br />
logging.info(&quot;Ended load tasks (%d users) %s&quot; % (count, datetime.datetime.now()))<br />
 <br />
The Url call for this method: (&#8216;/taskloader/&#8217;, TaskLoader),</p>




<p>The Skeleton code for step 2:<br />
 <br />
class TaskWorker(BaseRequestHandler):  <br />
    def post(self):  <br />
        key = self.request.get(&#39;key&#39;)  </p>




<p>        t = &#39;&#39;.join([&quot;http://django.gpowered.net/xmppproxy/&quot;, key])  </p>




<p>        logging.info(&quot;URL !%s!&quot; % t)  <br />
        result = urlfetch.fetch(t,  <br />
                                None,  <br />
                                urlfetch.GET,  <br />
                                {&#39;Cache-Control&#39;:&#39;no-cache,max-age=0&#39;, &#39;Pragma&#39;:&#39;no-cache&#39;})   <br />
 <br />
Url call for this method: (&#8216;/worker/&#8217;, TaskWorker),</p>




<p>So, TaskLoader loads all of the users into the Task queue.  App Engine processes these when it has the cpu cycles to do so, and for each of these, TaskWorker is called<br />
 <br />
I can schedule these using cron.yaml in my project:<br />
 <br />
cron:  <br />
- description: load the task queue  <br />
url: /taskloader/  <br />
schedule: every 30 minutes<br />
 <br />
This is a general overview of how to break up your batch in to smaller, easier to manage tasks.  Please see the App Engine <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/overview.html">documentation </a>for more detailed information.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Another one of mine on the work blog - <br /><br /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.alexanderinteractive.com/blog/2009/11/online-advertising-moving-to-your-car.html">Online advertising moving to&#8230;. your car?</a>: &#8221;<p>With the release of <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/android-2.0-highlights.html">Android 2.0</a> on the Motorola <a href="http://www.motorola.com/Consumers/US-EN/Consumer-Product-and-Services/Mobile-Phones/Motorola-DROID-US-EN">Droid</a>, the Google Maps for Mobile application brings turn by turn GPS navigation (with voice) to your car.  A great feature by far, it actually made Garmin and TomTom&#8217;s stocks <a href="http://www.wiseandroid.com/NewsItem.aspx?category=News&amp;path=October&amp;itemid=37">tank</a>, but what does it mean for the future?  </p></p>

<p>Currently adwords is all over the web; on pages, in your mail, on maps.  Now picture this possibility and keep in mind this is all hypothetical: You are using Navigator to get you to the local movie theater and it randomly chimes in with &#8216;You are about to pass Joe&#8217;s Pizza!&#8217;  This could be good and bad.  Good because you might be able to set the navigator to find restaurants you&#8217;ve never tried and didn&#8217;t know were there.  Bad because it could get annoying.  Good because it would open up a whole new form of advertising for small businesses.  </p>




<p>Either way, just something to think about, times are changing with all the technology we now carry around in our pockets.</p>




<p>A demo of navigator in action:</p>

<p>Those that hate Google but travel frequently might feel a bit conflicted over the next couple of months because of Googles holiday gift to America. Starting today and ending on January 15th, Google will be offering up free, no strings attached Wi-Fi at 47 airports while Virgin American flyers will be getting free in-flight Wi-Fi as of the 18th. The In addition to this, Google has set up a way for travelers at each airport to donate to charities Engineers Without Borders, the One Economy Corporation and Climate Savers Computing Initiative. Google will match each airports donations up to $250,000 and will also give the most generous airport $15,000 for the charity of its choosing.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m a&#8217;bloggin on the company blog! (Alexander Interactive)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.alexanderinteractive.com/blog/2009/10/google-wave-as-a-project-collaboration-tool.html">Google Wave as a Project Collaboration Tool</a>: &#8221;<p>If you aren&#8217;t already familiar with Google Wave, check out some basic info, and a very in-depth video <a href="http://wave.google.com/help/wave/about.html">here</a>.  Wave is a new project from Google that reinvents email communication.  Forget everything you know about email, it was invented back in the 70&#8217;s, things have changed; technology is faster, we have cloud computing, web apps look fancier, and for a while, a large portion of email users are moving (back) to web based clients. </p></p>

<p>Email is the current method of communication and collaboration when working on a project.  You usually have a folder for that project in Outlook, some rules to filter project related messages into that folder, and an email chain for each issue. People reply to messages inside that chain somewhere, the thread gets continued, people get added to the thread, people drop off.  You don&#8217;t know where you are in the chain when you check in a few hours later, and you get bombarded by&#8230; STOP! </p>




<p>Wave is very early in its adoption, it&#8217;s invite only, but it has the strong potential to fix a lot of these problems.  It can clean up a lot of the clutter of project communication and throw it on the cloud so you can get to it anywhere.  Wave does need some more security built in for the corporate settings, but that is in the pipeline.  Right now waves can only be private or public, but once inside a private wave, that user can invite anyone. </p>




<p>Some notes on how Wave can help a project:<ul><br />
 <li>Each Project would get its own folder in wave</li><br />
 <li>Anyone working on the project would have access to this folder</li><br />
 <li>Every issue or conversation would get its own wave and everyone who needs to be involved in the issue is added to the wave. </li><br />
 <li>At this point every project related message is confined to the projects folder.  No Outlook rules or message dragging will ever be needed.  If a new person needs to be involved in the discussion, they are just added to the wave, no forwarding or reply-all.</li><br />
 <li>The conversation can continue similar to email, with individual replies, but it can be so much more.  In line replies with related topics can appear right with the original topic, not hidden down 6 replies in an email chain</li><br />
 <li>You can show only new replies on the wave and get caught back up in the discussion quickly</li><br />
 <li>You can do a playback of all or part of the discussion and see who chimed in and when</li><br />
 <li>Need to share documents? You will eventually be able to drag them right out of your file system into the browser and into the wave.  (This is currently only supported for pictures) </li><br />
</ul></p>




<p>As I said, Wave is very early in its adoption, but after more people join, and more developer plugins come out, I think it will be a very valuable tool both in the workplace and at home.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>WOOHOO!!!!  It&#8217;s working on my verizon blackberry!<br /><br /></p>

<p>&#8220;Up until now, if you wanted to use <a href="http://google.com/voice">Google Voice</a>, you needed to choose a new number (a &#8220;Google number&#8221;). Taking calls through your Google number allows us to offer features like call recording, call screening and getting text messages via email. But we know not everyone wants to switch to a new phone number, so it made sense for us to create a lighter version of Google Voice for people who are willing to trade some features for the ability to use their existing numbers.<br /><br /></p>

<p>We&#8217;re excited to announce that you now have the choice to get Google Voice with your existing mobile number OR with a Google number.<br /><br /></p>

<p>If you sign up using your existing number, you&#8217;ll still get many of Google Voice&#8217;s features. Most notably, you&#8217;ll get all the functionality of Google voicemail, as explained in this video:<br /><br /></p>

<br /><br />


<p>If you already have a Google Voice account, you can <a href="http://www.google.com/support/voice/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=164652">add Google voicemail</a> to any mobile phone you&#8217;ve linked to your account. If you&#8217;re not yet using Google Voice, you can <a href="https://services.google.com/fb/forms/googlevoiceinvite/">request an invite</a> or ask a friend with a Google Voice account to send you an invitation. When you receive the invitation to sign up, you can choose to use Google Voice with your existing number  or to get a Google number for additional features.</p>

<br /><br />


<p>Google Voice is about giving you more control over your communications. We hope this new option makes it easier for you to manage your messages and personalize your voicemail experience.&#8221;</p>

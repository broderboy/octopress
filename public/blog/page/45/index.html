  <div class="entry-content"><p>Blogger, good.  FeedBurner, good.  Google Webmaster tools, good.  The 3 working together? A little more difficult.  A few months ago blogger <a href="http://buzz.blogger.com/2007/07/attention-FeedBurner-fans.html">added support</a> to have FeedBurner + blogger integration.  No more editing template code, just change a setting in blogger, and viola, FeedBurner will track all your subscribers.  However, this method did not go over so well with Google Webmaster Tools.  Previously you could just add your blog&#8217;s feed as a sitemap for you blog and the Google Bot would have no problem.  If you turned on FeedBurner however, sitemap errors popped up all over because the FeedBurner links were on a different domain from the blog, etc..<br /><br /></p>

<p>Here is a way to make it work (assuming you already have a blog set up):<br /><br /></p>

<ol>
<li>Make an account on <a href="http://www.FeedBurner.com/fb/a/home">FeedBurner</a> and add your blog to it<br /><br />
<img src="http://lh6.google.com/timothy.broder/RvE7pPREi1I/AAAAAAAAMRQ/rgAU_migW2A/s400/feedburne.jpg?imgdl=1" border=1/><br /><br /></li>

<li>Then, in blogger go to settings > Site Feed > Post Feed Redirect URL and add your FeedBurner feed<br /><br />
<img src="http://lh6.google.com/timothy.broder/RvE7pPREi2I/AAAAAAAAMRY/yy7Obs753HM/s400/FeedBurner2.jpg?imgdl=1" border=1/><br /><br /></li>

<li>Finally, if you want to track your blog in <a href="www.google.com/webmasters/sitemaps/">Google Webmaster Tools</a> you will have to add the sitemap a little differently then normal.  Add a General Web sitemap as the &#8220;rss.xml?orderby=updated&#8221; feed off of your blog.  FeedBurner does not pick up this feed in the redirects, so the Google Bot will not have trouble with it.<br /><br />
<img src="http://lh3.google.com/timothy.broder/RvE7pfREi3I/AAAAAAAAMRg/s_PLXzrV9hE/s400/FeedBurner3.jpg?imgdl=1" border=1/><br /><br /></li>
<li>After this your site will be tracked by FeedBurner as well as Google Webmaster tools and the Google Bot will be able to use the sitemap properly<br /><br /></li>
</ol>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I love to read.  I always have and I probably always will.  When people ask me why I read so much or about how fast I can, I usually attest to the fact that when I was a child, the household rule was no television on weekdays, so, lots of books and reading.  I still remember the first book I was able to finish on my own without any help from my mother; The Mouse and the Motorcycle.<br /><br /></p>

<p>A few months ago when I was looking for a service to keep track of all my books (those I had read and those I wanted), the top two that I had come up with were <a href="http://www.shelfari.com/">Shelfari</a> and <a href="http://www.librarything.com/">LibraryThing</a>.  At the time LibraryThing seemed slow and clunky while Shelfari came off as fairly polished.  Note that I really didnt spend too much time at either during this initial assessment and that I ended up going with Shelfari.<br /><br /></p>

<p>Coming back to the present, I still use Shelfari and now that <a href="http://books.google.com/">Google Book search</a> has come out with the <a href="http://books.google.com/googlebooks/mylibrary/">My Library</a> feature, its time to do an assessment of this decision. <br /><br /></p>

<p><b>My Library</b><br /></p>

<p>Launched on September 6th, this is the latest feature of Google Book Search.  Normally I just go to Amazon if Im looking for a book, but thats more likely because thats what I am used to.  Check out my test Library <a href="http://books.google.com/books?as_list=BDYjGJ9gQiI2fwZ2RhK_5ARoUEnPi_37Mmen-Zjyn9rNza5Y7yew&hl=en">here</a><br /><br />
<img src="http://lh6.google.com/timothy.broder/RvCD9fREiyI/AAAAAAAAMQ4/Rm4fglWiqd4/s400/mylibrary.jpg?imgdl=1" border=1/><br /><br />
Pros<br /></p>

<ul>
<li>Search doesnt always return what I want.  Sometimes I had to go find the ISBN and use that</li>
<li>Very fast searching</li>
<li>Once books are added to the library, you can search the text within those books and get a preview</li>
<li>Has List view and cover view.  The list view has a link to Add Labels, Write a Review, and More Editions</li>
<li>Links to buy the book from Amazon, Barns & Noble, Booksense, or Froogle</li>
<li>Can look for the book in a library</li>
<li>Reviews from all over the internet (shows 10)</li>
<li>References from all over the internet (shows 10)</li>
<li>References from other books</li>
<li>Links to other editions</li>
<li>References from scholarly works</li>
<li>Can share list as an RSS feed</li>
<li>No need to sign up if you already have a Google account</li>
<li>Unlimited books</li></ul>


<br />


<p>Cons<br /></p>

<ul>
<li>limited preview, I know other services dont even offer a preview, but its such a tease</li>
<li>The library didnt seem to be finding good results.  I looked up a few books that I know are in the library up the street and it wasnt finding them.</li>
<li>No user reviews</li>
<li>Only export format is RSS</li>
<li>Can only import by ISBN by typing a list or copy/paste</li>
<li>Need a Google account</li></ul>


<br /> 


<p><b>LibraryThing</b><br />
I had initially been turned off by this one because the UI seemed clunky and was sluggish when I first tested it out.  A lot of this has changed.  Check out my test library <a href="http://www.librarything.com/catalog/broderboy">here</a><br /><br />
<img src="http://lh6.google.com/timothy.broder/RvCD9fREizI/AAAAAAAAMRA/rPQTBXANWPg/s400/librarything.jpg?imgdl=1" border=1/><br /><br />
Pros<br /></p>

<ul>
<li>If you really like Amazon (me), then using that as the database is a pro</li>
<li>Good recommendations.  The recommendations were pretty spot on.  There are books on the list that I have been meaning to read for a while now (that I have not yet added)</li>
<li>Lots of Find At (buy) options: Abebooks, Alibris, Amazon, Barnes & Noble, BookFinder, BookSense, Worldcat, and more</li>
<li>The size differences and bolding in the tag cloud make it pretty easy to spot trends</li>
<li>Reviews by users</li>
<li>I love the book swapping links</li>
<li>Good rating system (out of 5)</li>
<li>Links to related Wikipedia articles</li>
<li>Lots of options for blog cloud</li>
<li>Can link with other social sites: Facebook, Digg, etc</li></ul>


<br />


<p>Cons<br /></p>

<ul>
<li>only searches Amazon of the Library of congress</li>
<li>You can only save 200 books.  Lame.  They charge $10/year or $25/lifetime to store unlimited books</li>
<li>The Display styles of A, B, C, D, E are confusing if you dont go look up what they mean</li>
<li>The click on cover menu takes a little while to get used to</li>
<li>Blog cloud is static</li>
<li>Has a lot of social aspects, but no Friends</li></ul>

</script>


<br /><br />


<p><b>Shelfari</b><br />
This is the service I originally went with.  Check out my main shelf <a href="http://www.shelfari.com/broderboy/shelf">here</a><br /><br />
<img src="http://lh6.google.com/timothy.broder/RvCD9fREi0I/AAAAAAAAMRI/GZLVbfjMVig/s400/shelfari.jpg?imgdl=1" border=1/><br /><br />
Pros<br /></p>

<ul>
<li>Multiple shelves</li>
<li>Friends and groups, seems more social then the other two.  (LibraryThing links to social aspects, but doesnt have them as built in as Shelfari)</li>
<li>Quite pretty</li>
<li>Member reviews and Amazon reviews (linked separately)</li>
<li>Can write notes (different from reviews) about each book or a shelf in general</li></ul>


<br />


<p>Cons<br /></p>

<ul>
<li>Requires Flash</li>
<li>Can only buy from Amazon</li>
<li>Tag cloud doesnt have enough difference in size</li>
<li>Ads at the bottom of each page</li>
<li>Has social aspect of friends, but doesnt reach out to other social sites</li></ul>


<br />


<p>Shelfari Blog Widget:<br />

<p>All in all I think I may stick with Shelfari.  Yes My Library was the fastest for searching, and did relate the books to the most external sources, but sometimes it took a little longer to find the book I was looking for in the list.  My searches in Shelfari, while slower always had the book I wanted in the top 3 results.  I really like the recommendation and book swapping features of LibraryThing.  What sold me on Shelfari and continues to do so, is the multiple shelves.  I have a shelf for books I own and have read, a shelf for books I own but have not read, and a shelf for books I would like to buy.  I just really like breaking it up this way.  The only thing that could make this aspect better, would be if I could like my third list to my Amazon wish list.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Alas and woes, one of my favorite authors, <a href="http://www.dragonmount.com/RobertJordan/">Robert Jordan</a> has passed away.  RJ is the author of the magnificent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wheel_of_Time">The Wheel of Time</a> Series.  The series currently had 11 books plus a prequel.  Jordan was feverishly working on the 12th and final book entitled A Memory of Light.  My old Roommate <a href="http://www.shelfari.com/Kitster">Kit</a> got me into it and though I had previously tried the series when I was about 10 I didn&#8217;t get into it, this time around I instantly fell in love with The Eye of the World (first book).  I put RJ&#8217;s work on the same level as Tolkien, who is my all time favorite author.  Robert Jordan came to &#8220;dominate the world that Tolkien began to reveal to us.&#8221;  One of the words at the bottom of gpowered.net comes from a reference to the main character, Rand.<br /><br /></p>

<p>RJ, you gave me a great world to escape this one into.  I will miss you dearly.  Rest in Peace and become a Memory of Light.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Google has acquired <a href="http://www.postini.com/index.php">Postini</a> to better improve Google Apps.<br /><br /></p>

<p>A blurb from Postini&#8217;s website:<br />
<i>With Postini Solutions, you can secure all of your electronic communications - email, instant messaging and the web  and manage your company&#8217;s communication policies from one central location. Postini Solutions can also make it easy to meet your archiving and encryption needs.</i><br /><br /></p>

<p>Things I would like to see come out of this:<br />
- The ability to encrypt Gmail messages and Google Docs without having to use greasemonkey<br />
- A Google API to encrypt files and transfers in your own application or site<br />
- (Ad?) subsidized access to Postini services<br /></p>

<br />


<p>The question on the tip of my tongue is, is Postini going to remain a separate entity though owned by Google, or are its services going to be completely integrated into Google&#8217;s services?</p>

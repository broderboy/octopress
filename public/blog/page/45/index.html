  <div class="entry-content"><p>Alas and woes, one of my favorite authors, <a href="http://www.dragonmount.com/RobertJordan/">Robert Jordan</a> has passed away.  RJ is the author of the magnificent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wheel_of_Time">The Wheel of Time</a> Series.  The series currently had 11 books plus a prequel.  Jordan was feverishly working on the 12th and final book entitled A Memory of Light.  My old Roommate <a href="http://www.shelfari.com/Kitster">Kit</a> got me into it and though I had previously tried the series when I was about 10 I didn&#8217;t get into it, this time around I instantly fell in love with The Eye of the World (first book).  I put RJ&#8217;s work on the same level as Tolkien, who is my all time favorite author.  Robert Jordan came to &#8220;dominate the world that Tolkien began to reveal to us.&#8221;  One of the words at the bottom of gpowered.net comes from a reference to the main character, Rand.<br /><br /></p>

<p>RJ, you gave me a great world to escape this one into.  I will miss you dearly.  Rest in Peace and become a Memory of Light.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Google has acquired <a href="http://www.postini.com/index.php">Postini</a> to better improve Google Apps.<br /><br /></p>

<p>A blurb from Postini&#8217;s website:<br />
<i>With Postini Solutions, you can secure all of your electronic communications - email, instant messaging and the web  and manage your company&#8217;s communication policies from one central location. Postini Solutions can also make it easy to meet your archiving and encryption needs.</i><br /><br /></p>

<p>Things I would like to see come out of this:<br />
- The ability to encrypt Gmail messages and Google Docs without having to use greasemonkey<br />
- A Google API to encrypt files and transfers in your own application or site<br />
- (Ad?) subsidized access to Postini services<br /></p>

<br />


<p>The question on the tip of my tongue is, is Postini going to remain a separate entity though owned by Google, or are its services going to be completely integrated into Google&#8217;s services?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Completely off topic, but I had to share.  Last Thursday I had the amazing privilege to play Halo 3 on the Lincoln Center IMAX Screen.  It was amazing.  For those of you that don&#8217;t know, the Lincoln center IMAX screen is 70-something feet tall.  The master chief was bigger then me.  My buddy who got the tickets was on line around 6:30, I shower up around 8 or so (they were only letting the first 200 people play), and we got into the theater around 9pm.<br /><br /></p>

<p>Joe Tung and Luke started off by running through a campaign demo, showing off the saved video features, and blowing stuff up with Forge.  The campaign demo we saw was &#8216;The Storm&#8217; which had never been seen before.  They fought through some baddies but turned off the demo as a gigantic spider mech came on to the screen, I guess we have to wait a few more days to see the rest of that&#8230;</p>

<br /><br />After the demos they let us play some slayer!    8 people at a time in 6 min rounds, I was #164 so I had to wait a bit, no worries though, seeing the other games on the giant screen made it worth the wait.  When I got to play though, they only let 6 gamers onto the consoles&#8230; why? Joe and Luke had decided to join the fun!  Playing Halo 3 against a producer and developer&#8230; super cool!  I, of course, had my ass royally handed to me.  I wish I had some photos to show but the security was pretty tight.  In retrospect I should have tried to take a few on my way out.  I had played and had nothing to lose&#8230; oh well&#8230;<br /><br />


<p>Halo 3 can&#8217;t come soon enough (and I actually have a 360 now)&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was trying very hard to get the next HOWTO online last night.  I got it about 3/4 of the way done but then went to bed so I could go to the gym this morning, but then I ended up setting my alarm for 6pm instead of 6am&#8230;. so that was a waste I probably could have finished it.  Tonight I&#8217;m going to test out Halo 3 on the <a href="http://www.fandango.com/amcloewslincolnsquare13withimax_aabqi/theaterpage">Lincoln Center Imax Screen</a> which should just be crazy.  Until then here&#8217;s a good article I read yesterday entitled <a href="http://performancing.com/will-the-google-bashers-please-shut-up">Will The Google Bashers Please Shut Up?</a><br /><br /></p>

<p>Till later, I&#8217;ll see what time I get back tonight&#8230;</p>

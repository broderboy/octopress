Twitter users on Thursday will, for the first time, be able to <a href="http://digg.com/d314ZwX">make voice calls</a> directly to each other through the microblogging service. <br />
<br />
<br />
Look out, Facebook users: <a href="http://digg.com/d314NzW">Here comes voice chat</a>.<br />
<br />
Sometime in the next few weeks, the social network's tens of millions of users will begin to be able to have high-quality voice conversations, even as its third-party developers are able to start including voice in their applications.

I haven't been to crazy about how Blogger's default tag/label list looks lately.  On some of my shorter posts it was taking up most of the vertical space on the page.  I looked around to see if I could find a more traditional tag cloud.  I found a pretty good (and very easy) <a href="http://phydeaux3.blogspot.com/2006/09/code-for-beta-blogger-label-cloud.html">tutorial</a> and just installed it. I have to play with the colors a bit but I like the way it looks.

Normally I don't just link to other posts, but Scoble's <a href="http://scobleizer.com/2008/05/19/why-microsoft-will-buy-facebook-and-keep-it-closed/">latest article</a> is quite a read.  It delves into Microsoft + Yahoo Search + Facebook giving Google and the rest of the open web quite a hard time.  Definitely work the time to read.

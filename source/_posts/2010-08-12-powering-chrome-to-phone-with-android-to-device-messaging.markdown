Android <a href="http://code.google.com/android/c2dm/">Cloud to Device Messaging (C2DM)</a> was launched recently as part of Android 2.2. C2DM enables third-party  developers to push lightweight data messages to the phone. C2DM created a  nice opportunity for us to pull together different Google developer  tools to create a simple but useful application to enable users to push  links and other information from their desktop / laptop to their phone.  The result was Chrome to Phone - a <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/jobs/lifeatgoogle/englife/">20-percent time</a> project at Google.

<a href="http://chrome.blogspot.com/">Chrome to Phone</a> comprises a Chrome Extension, an Android Application, and a Google  AppEngine server. All of the code is open sourced and serves as a nice  example of how to use C2DM.

I really can't wait for the 2.2 update to my phone.

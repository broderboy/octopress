<b>Get your tweets onto Google Talk!</b><br /><br />

<a href="http://www.twitter.com">Twitter</a>: A free social networking and micro-blogging service that allows users to send "updates" (or "tweets"; text-based posts, up to 140 characters long) to the Twitter website, via short message service (SMS), instant messaging, or a third-party application such as Twitterrific or Facebook.<br /><br />

<a href="http://www.google.com/talk/">gTalk</a>: (Google Talk) is a Windows and web-based application for voice over internet (VOIP) and instant messaging, offered by Google. 
<br /><br />

<a href="http://twitter2gtalk.appspot.com/">twitter2gTalk</a>: Takes your current tweet and sets it as your Google Talk status (away) message.<br /><br />

I've been toying with <a href="http://blog.gpowered.net/2008/03/update-google-talk-status-with-twitter.html">this</a> for a while now.  I really wanted to launch twitter2gTalk as a service that anyone could use.  I had the backend code all done and was dragging my feet writing the django front-end.  I went to a hackathon for <a href="code.google.com/appengine/">Google AppEngine</a> and converted most of the code to run on that.  You need a Google Account to login, but then again, you need one to use gTalk anyway. <br /><br />

I hope some people will find this cool or useful (some people have been <a href="http://heavycrag.blogspot.com/2008/05/new-reason-to-tweet.html">waiting</a> for this and already signed up).  Feel free to follow <a href="http://twitter.com/broderboy">me</a> or <a href="http://twitter.com/twit2gTalk">the app</a> on twitter for feature updates or <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/gPpowered">subscribe</a> to this blog.

I'd really enjoy this.  1) I'm obviously addicted to my crackberry. 2) I'm not sure how I feel about lots of typing in a touch screen.  I played with the HTC Touch over the weekend.  It was cool, it was pretty, but the screen wasn't as responsive as I would have hoped.  We'll see what HTC can do with the <a href="http://www.htc.com/www/product.aspx?id=46278">Diamond</a> and the <a href="http://androidcommunity.com/first-live-images-of-fullscreen-android-demo-20080528/">Dream</a>

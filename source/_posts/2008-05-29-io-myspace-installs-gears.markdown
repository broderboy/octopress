Myspace unveiled a new search feature of their message center at Google I/O utilizing gears.  As you search your messages, results are shown in real time, coming out of the local cache stored in gears.  Hopefully this will give gears more publicity and other sited (<a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/05/28/myspace-shows-facebook-how-its-done-google-gears-to-power-messaging/">ahem</a>, facebook) will take a look at it ;)<br /><br />This almost makes me want to create a myspace account to go play with it... ALMOST...

I unfortunately haven't had time to touch Google reader in almost 2 weeks now, but just caught on <a href="http://lifehacker.com/398759/the-new-igoogle-gets-full+screen-gmail">lifehacker</a> that Google is rolling out a new personal homepage.  Some of you may have it enabled by default. If not, head over to <a href="http://www.google.com/ig/sandbox">www.google.com/ig/sandbox</a> and sign up to get into the developer sandbox.  If you aren't a developer, fake it.  My favorite addition is definitely full screen Gmail preview, which I can't get to at work.  I wonder how long until they block it....<br /><br />

You can now register domains in <a href="http://www.google.com/webmasters/">Webmaster Central</a> with non-English characters in them by
supporting IDNA (Internationalizing Domain Names in Applications).
Originally only domains with a-z, A-Z, 0-9, or '-' could be used.  I
tested it out and it looks like its working good!

<a href="http://developers.facebook.com/news.php?blog=1&amp;story=157">This </a>sounds like a lot of fun, some good presentations (interesting topics and good presenters), a live <a href="http://revision3.com/diggnation/">Diggnation</a>, and I LOVE London.&nbsp; Wish I could go<br />
<br />
Here's the lineup: <br />
<br />
Mark Zuckerberg - Fireside Chat<br />
Kevin Rose - The future of social news<br />
Dave Morin - A more social Web with <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/connect.php" target="_blank">Facebook Connect</a><br />
Joe Stump - Languages don't scale<br />
<br />
To wrap up the conference there will be a live Diggnation on the main stage (Oct 10). Directly after that will be the wrap up party which is rumored to have an open bar, but you didn't hear that from me

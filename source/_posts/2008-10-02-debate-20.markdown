Last week during the presidential debate, the country was a-twitter.&nbsp; There were a bunch of sites doing some sort of realtime web 2.0 shows of the debate, with a lot of these using twitter and hashtags.&nbsp; If anyone knows of any sites that I haven't listed below, please let me know<br />
<br />
We had the TV, a couple of laptops, and a few bottles of wine going and it turned out to be great fun.<br />
<br />
My favorite site was definitely Current's <a href="http://current.com/topics/88834922_hack_the_debate">Hack the Debate</a>&nbsp; It displays the video/audio of the debate, as well as real time tweets that are tagged with #current.&nbsp; This is where I'll be spending most of my time.<br />

#<a href="http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/2008/09/21/twitter-presidential-debates-sept-26/">tweetdebate</a> was an experiment to use twitter to track in real time who is winning, this is tracked using search.twitter.com.&nbsp; See the <a href="http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/2008/09/21/twitter-presidential-debates-sept-26/">site</a> for rules.<br />

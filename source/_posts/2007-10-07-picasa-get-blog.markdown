<a href="http://googlephotos.blogspot.com/2007/09/posted-by-jason-cook-product-marketing_28.html">Google Photos Blog: Ready for our close-up</a><br /><br />

The Picasa team has gotten a blog in the form of the <a href="http://googlephotos.blogspot.com/">Google Photos Blog</a>.  I think this brings the number of Google blogs to 75 (including the international blogs).  On the photo blog they will be posting feature updates to Picasa, photography tips, and the team's favorite photo albums.<br /><br />

In addition to working on <a href="http://picasa.google.com/">Picasa</a> and the <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/">Web albums features</a>, they are also in charge of hosting blogger's <a href="http://buzz.blogger.com/2007/03/blogger-and-picasa-web-albums.html">photo upload feature</a>, which is powered by Picasa web, developing Orkut's <a href="http://en.blog.orkut.com/2007/08/spice-up-your-scraps.html">photo picker</a>, and creating Mapplets for browsing <a href="http://google-latlong.blogspot.com/2007/08/posted-by-ping-hsin-chen-software.html">geotagged photos</a> inside of Google Maps.<br /><br />

Subscribe to their <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/GooglePicasaBlog">feed</a> for updates.

So I really have been digging the Windows 7 beta.&nbsp; However, Itunes does not sync podcasts correctly on the 64 bit version.&nbsp; IF syncing works at all, it takes a while. I had used winamp to listen to my music a while ago, but had switched to amarok when I started single booting linux (yes, I hated Vista that much).&nbsp; Now that I'm back to using windows a bit, I wanted my podcast experience to go flawlessly.<br />
<br />
As much as I dislike iTunes, they have got podcast management down pat<br />
<ul><li>search for podcast</li>
<li>subscribe to podcast</li>
<li>download episodes</li>
<li>sync with ipod</li>
<li><b>after an episode has been listened to, delete from computer hard drive</b></li>
</ul>That last point is the most important part, everything else can be done manually<br />
<br />
All this can be done with winamp. You will need two things, winamp and the <a href="http://mlipod.sourceforge.net/?page=downloads">ml_iPod</a> plugin.&nbsp; While winamp does come with ipod support built in, ml_iPod has many more features.&nbsp; The following steps should get you up to speed on podcasting with winamp<br />
<ul><li>install winamp</li>
<li> install the ml_iPod plugin (it will tell you it has to remove the built in ipod plugin, this is ok)</li>
<li>set a directory to save the episodes in<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Ng3QbVQfLZ8/SejSAesN5OI/AAAAAAAAbG8/i6n7ZuHGR7A/s1600-h/1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Ng3QbVQfLZ8/SejSAesN5OI/AAAAAAAAbG8/i6n7ZuHGR7A/s400/1.jpg" /></a></div></li>
<li>plug in your ipod</li>
<li>enable podcast support for the ipod</li>
<li>point it to your episode folder</li>
<li>set the query for when to delete old episodes<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Ng3QbVQfLZ8/SejS5pxj2JI/AAAAAAAAbHE/zU0cecph26A/s1600-h/2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Ng3QbVQfLZ8/SejS5pxj2JI/AAAAAAAAbHE/zU0cecph26A/s320/2.jpg" /></a></div></li>
<li>Add your podcasts by searching for them in the directory, or adding them manually using their RSS feed<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Ng3QbVQfLZ8/SejTsQ-8VoI/AAAAAAAAbHM/RGPUVDtoXpI/s1600-h/3.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Ng3QbVQfLZ8/SejTsQ-8VoI/AAAAAAAAbHM/RGPUVDtoXpI/s320/3.jpg" /></a></div></li>
</ul>After this you should be good to go. podcasts!

Finally!! No more using Yahoo Pipes to search the feeds!<br /><br />

I'm sitting here waiting for my friend Eli to pick me up from his apartment for a nice lunch over at dreamworks, glancing over a few feeds (I have a LOT to catch up on when I get back to NY), and one jumped out at me, the Google Reader Team has finally added a search box to Google reader.  <br /><br />

This box will search all of your feeds!  Also included in this release are:<br /><br />
- Ability to hide side navigation (I just tried it, it's very well done)<br />
- Unread count is now 1,000+ rather then 100+ (this is going to be good for me when I get back)<br />
- Forward and Back buttons now have more responsiveness when moving between folders and feeds<br /><br />

Check out <a href="http://blogsearch.google.com/">Google Blog Search</a> for more blog searching.

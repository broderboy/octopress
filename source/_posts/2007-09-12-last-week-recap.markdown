These are just a few highlights from while I was gone...<br /><br />

<a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2007/09/our-plans-for-code-jam.html">Google</a> Starts talking about a possible coding competition and gives some practice problems.  Maybe I'll take a crack at them on the train on Friday...<br /><br />

<a href="http://googlemashupeditor.blogspot.com/2007/08/more-new-stuff-831-feature-release.html">Google Mashup Editor</a> had a feature release.  Check out the post for the full list but my favorite new features include:<br />
- Ability to edit XML, CSS and HTML files uploaded into the editor.<br />
- New Tab styling and custom placement of tabs via CSS<br />
- Documentation for new features<br /><br />

<a href="http://blogoscoped.com/archive/2007-08-30-n76.html">Blogoscoped</a> reported that iGoogle now has gadget to gadget communication.  I think this will lead to the design of whole tabs with smaller more placeable gadgets that talk to each other rather then bigger uglier (possibly sluggish?) gadgets.<br /><br />

<a href="http://jessenoller.com/2007/08/31/python-30-alpha-1-released-you-want-it-because-its-cool/trackback/">Jessen Oller</a>: "Python 3.0 Alpha 1 released: You want it because its cool." Mmmmmmmmmm python.  Get it <a href="http://python.org/download/releases/3.0/">here</a><br /><br />

<a href="http://google-code-updates.blogspot.com/2007/08/google-web-toolkit-out-of-beta-as-of-14.html">GWT</a> 1.4 came out of beta<br /><br />

<a href="http://gearsblog.blogspot.com/2007/08/google-gears-02-developer-release-ready.html">Google Gears</a> 0.2 developer release ready for download.  New features include:<br />
- Crosss-origin API support<br />
- HttpRequest and Timer modules (can be used as workers)<br /><br />

<a href="http://blogoscoped.com/archive/2007-09-03-n45.html">Blogoscoped</a> reported that there are now new layout options on iGoogle.  <a href="http://www.google.com/ig">Check it out</a><br /><br />

<a href="http://google-d-s.blogspot.com/2007/09/lazy-wednesday.html">Google Spreadsheets</a> got autocomplete.  Its pretty nifty.  It even understands Sun, Mon, and then what should come next, same for months and others.

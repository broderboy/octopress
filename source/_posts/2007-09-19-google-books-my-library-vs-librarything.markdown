I love to read.  I always have and I probably always will.  When people ask me why I read so much or about how fast I can, I usually attest to the fact that when I was a child, the household rule was no television on weekdays, so, lots of books and reading.  I still remember the first book I was able to finish on my own without any help from my mother; The Mouse and the Motorcycle.<br /><br />

A few months ago when I was looking for a service to keep track of all my books (those I had read and those I wanted), the top two that I had come up with were <a href="http://www.shelfari.com/">Shelfari</a> and <a href="http://www.librarything.com/">LibraryThing</a>.  At the time LibraryThing seemed slow and clunky while Shelfari came off as fairly polished.  Note that I really didnt spend too much time at either during this initial assessment and that I ended up going with Shelfari.<br /><br />

Coming back to the present, I still use Shelfari and now that <a href="http://books.google.com/">Google Book search</a> has come out with the <a href="http://books.google.com/googlebooks/mylibrary/">My Library</a> feature, its time to do an assessment of this decision. <br /><br />
 

<b>My Library</b><br />

Launched on September 6th, this is the latest feature of Google Book Search.  Normally I just go to Amazon if Im looking for a book, but thats more likely because thats what I am used to.  Check out my test Library <a href="http://books.google.com/books?as_list=BDYjGJ9gQiI2fwZ2RhK_5ARoUEnPi_37Mmen-Zjyn9rNza5Y7yew&hl=en">here</a><br /><br />

Pros<br />
<ul>
<li>Search doesnt always return what I want.  Sometimes I had to go find the ISBN and use that</li>
<li>Very fast searching</li>
<li>Once books are added to the library, you can search the text within those books and get a preview</li>
<li>Has List view and cover view.  The list view has a link to Add Labels, Write a Review, and More Editions</li>
<li>Links to buy the book from Amazon, Barns & Noble, Booksense, or Froogle</li>
<li>Can look for the book in a library</li>
<li>Reviews from all over the internet (shows 10)</li>
<li>References from all over the internet (shows 10)</li>
<li>References from other books</li>
<li>Links to other editions</li>
<li>References from scholarly works</li>
<li>Can share list as an RSS feed</li>
<li>No need to sign up if you already have a Google account</li>
<li>Unlimited books</li></ul><br />

Cons<br />
<ul>
<li>limited preview, I know other services dont even offer a preview, but its such a tease</li>
<li>The library didnt seem to be finding good results.  I looked up a few books that I know are in the library up the street and it wasnt finding them.</li>
<li>No user reviews</li>
<li>Only export format is RSS</li>
<li>Can only import by ISBN by typing a list or copy/paste</li>
<li>Need a Google account</li></ul><br /> 

<b>LibraryThing</b><br />
I had initially been turned off by this one because the UI seemed clunky and was sluggish when I first tested it out.  A lot of this has changed.  Check out my test library <a href="http://www.librarything.com/catalog/broderboy">here</a><br /><br /> 
<img src="http://lh6.google.com/timothy.broder/RvCD9fREizI/AAAAAAAAMRA/rPQTBXANWPg/s400/librarything.jpg?imgdl=1" border=1/><br /><br />
Pros<br />
<ul>
<li>If you really like Amazon (me), then using that as the database is a pro</li>
<li>Good recommendations.  The recommendations were pretty spot on.  There are books on the list that I have been meaning to read for a while now (that I have not yet added)</li>
<li>Lots of Find At (buy) options: Abebooks, Alibris, Amazon, Barnes & Noble, BookFinder, BookSense, Worldcat, and more</li>
<li>The size differences and bolding in the tag cloud make it pretty easy to spot trends</li>
<li>Reviews by users</li>
<li>I love the book swapping links</li>
<li>Good rating system (out of 5)</li>
<li>Links to related Wikipedia articles</li>
<li>Lots of options for blog cloud</li>
<li>Can link with other social sites: Facebook, Digg, etc</li></ul><br />
Cons<br />
<ul>
<li>only searches Amazon of the Library of congress</li>
<li>You can only save 200 books.  Lame.  They charge $10/year or $25/lifetime to store unlimited books</li>
<li>The Display styles of A, B, C, D, E are confusing if you dont go look up what they mean</li>
<li>The click on cover menu takes a little while to get used to</li>
<li>Blog cloud is static</li>
<li>Has a lot of social aspects, but no Friends</li></ul><br />

<b>Shelfari</b><br />
This is the service I originally went with.  Check out my main shelf <a href="http://www.shelfari.com/broderboy/shelf">here</a><br /><br /> 
<img src="http://lh6.google.com/timothy.broder/RvCD9fREi0I/AAAAAAAAMRI/GZLVbfjMVig/s400/shelfari.jpg?imgdl=1" border=1/><br /><br />
Pros<br />
<ul>
<li>Multiple shelves</li>
<li>Friends and groups, seems more social then the other two.  (LibraryThing links to social aspects, but doesnt have them as built in as Shelfari)</li>
<li>Quite pretty</li>
<li>Member reviews and Amazon reviews (linked separately)</li>
<li>Can write notes (different from reviews) about each book or a shelf in general</li></ul><br />

Cons<br />
<ul>
<li>Requires Flash</li>
<li>Can only buy from Amazon</li>
<li>Tag cloud doesnt have enough difference in size</li>
<li>Ads at the bottom of each page</li>
<li>Has social aspect of friends, but doesnt reach out to other social sites</li></ul><br />

All in all I think I may stick with Shelfari.  Yes My Library was the fastest for searching, and did relate the books to the most external sources, but sometimes it took a little longer to find the book I was looking for in the list.  My searches in Shelfari, while slower always had the book I wanted in the top 3 results.  I really like the recommendation and book swapping features of LibraryThing.  What sold me on Shelfari and continues to do so, is the multiple shelves.  I have a shelf for books I own and have read, a shelf for books I own but have not read, and a shelf for books I would like to buy.  I just really like breaking it up this way.  The only thing that could make this aspect better, would be if I could like my third list to my Amazon wish list.

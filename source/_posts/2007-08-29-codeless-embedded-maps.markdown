Google Maps released <a href="http://google-latlong.blogspot.com/2007/08/youtube-style-embeddable-maps_21.html">Embeddable Maps</a>.  It's as easy as embedding youtube
videos.  All you have to do is create your map, and then under the "Link
to this page" menu, there is a new option under the link that has some
HTML iframe code to add the map anywhere.  Check out the next post to
see the trip to Syracuse I took this weekend to go to the New York State Fair.

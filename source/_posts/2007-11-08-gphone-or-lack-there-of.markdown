To be honest, when I heard that Google was going to announce whatever it is they have been working on with a "gPhone" I was really excited.  The announcement of Android, their new open mobile platform is cool and all, but I was a little disappointed.  Granted thats because might have been expecting something as cool as the iPhone, or that I desperately need a new phone.  I've been following the <a href="http://www.openmoko.com/">openmoko</a> project and its going to be intersting how Android compares to it.

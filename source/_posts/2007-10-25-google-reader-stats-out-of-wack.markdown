First, <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/10/14/top-blogs-on-google-reader/">Techcrunch</a> came up with a list of the top blogs that users subscribe to using Google Reader. The top 3 on the list were BBC with 202,463, Google News wih 192,100, and ESPN with 189,274 .  Remember, these are only the stats if the subscriber is using Google Reader, obviously there are blogs with a higher subscription count, such as the <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/">Official Google Blog</a> (They still haven't moved over to blogs.google.com eh?) with over 669,000 subscribers as reported by FeedBurner.  
<br /><br />

It was all well and good that Google Reader showed high stats for these blogs, but.... we were apparently duped...<br /><br />

In his article <a href="http://mashable.com/2007/10/15/google-reader-stats-are-bullshit-with-proof/">Google Reader Stats are BullSh*t (With Proof)</a>, Pete Cashmore goes into his explanation of the "default feed effect."  A default feed is a feed that comes already subscribed in a news aggregator  , or is part of a default group (like say Digg, Engadget, and Gizmodo being in the Technology group on Google Reader).  Being in these groups is a major traffic boost.<br /><br />

However the system has some flaws
<ul><li>There is subscription data for feeds that don't exist</li><li>
Google Reader does not check to see if a subscriber is active or not.  (Someone signs up for Reader, adds a feed, and never touches Reader again, they count as a subscriber)</li><li>
Feedburner pulls some stats from Google Reader</li><li>
This problem is not limited to Google Reader.  It includes many feed readers and start pages</li></ul>
<br /><br />

Tune in next time after I do some research into how out wack FeedBurner statistics are.

Google has acquired <a href="http://www.postini.com/index.php">Postini</a> to better improve Google Apps.<br /><br />

A blurb from Postini's website:<br />
<i>With Postini Solutions, you can secure all of your electronic communications - email, instant messaging and the web  and manage your company's communication policies from one central location. Postini Solutions can also make it easy to meet your archiving and encryption needs.</i><br /><br />

Things I would like to see come out of this:<br />
- The ability to encrypt Gmail messages and Google Docs without having to use greasemonkey<br />
- A Google API to encrypt files and transfers in your own application or site<br />
- (Ad?) subsidized access to Postini services<br />
<br />

The question on the tip of my tongue is, is Postini going to remain a separate entity though owned by Google, or are its services going to be completely integrated into Google's services?

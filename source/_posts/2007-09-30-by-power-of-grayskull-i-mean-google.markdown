Most of my friends got the reference to the "By the Power of Google" tagline that I chose to use for gPowered.  Being a child of the 80's I had the privilege to watch some of the greatest cartoons ever created.  One of those, was He-Man where one of the popular lines is "BY THE POWER OF GRAYSKULL."  When I was throwing around taglines with "powered by" (powered by Google), He-Man's line kept popping into my head and stuck.  If you don't know what He-Man is, check out the short summery from wikipedia.<br /><br />

<i>The show takes place on the fictional planet of Eternia, a land of magic, myth and fantasy. The show's lead character is Prince Adam, the young son of Eternia's rulers, King Randor and Queen Marlena. Prince Adam is a seemingly cowardly, blond muscleman dressed in a Cote d'Azur chemise. However, Prince Adam possesses a magic sword, and when he holds it aloft and says the magic words "By the Power of Grayskull! I have the Power!" he is transformed into He-Man, the most powerful man in the universe. He-Man is a brave, blond muscleman in a baldric and loincloth. Together with his close allies, Battle Cat, Teela, Man-At-Arms and Orko, He-Man uses his powers to defend Eternia from the evil forces of Skeletor, a tyrannical warlord with a skull for a face. Skeletor's main goal is to conquer the mysterious fortress of Castle Grayskull, from which He-Man draws his powers. If he succeeds, Skeletor would be able to conquer not only Eternia, but the whole universe.</i> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/He-Man_and_the_Masters_of_the_Universe">wikipedia</a>)<br /><br />

And now for a blast from the past, here is the opening theme complete with the famous lines.<br /><br />

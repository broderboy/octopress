Do you want the GDrive?  I know I do.  Rumors have been flying around for almost 2 years about this thing, its been the brunt of an April Fool's joke, complete with official announcement and a Google Group (see below).  Googlers use it, and if it ever comes out, it would change the way both home and corporate users think about file storage.  Google is almost there, almost.  When they integrate Gears into Docs they'll be one step closer.  They would just need a few more features on the main Docs UI (bulk file upload, share files right from there instead of having to publish from within the document) and allow for any file type. <br /><br />

Quick recap of the internal GDrive / Platypus client:<br />
Backup: if your computer goes down, catches on fire, or just plain old BSOD's, just get a new computer, install the platypus client, and your files <br />will be on the new system before you know it
You can sync across multiple computers.  Great if you have multiple buildings, cubes, or a laptop floating around<br />
VPN-less access<br />
Disconnect Access.  Google Gears anyone?<br />
Other users can just mount your shares on their filesystem<br />
FAST<br /><br />

I took some time and went through similar offerings that are currently available<br /><br />

<br /><br />

Overall I think I would have to go with Box.net.  It was really smooth.  Had some good features and it was really easy to upload files.  the free 5 gigs wasn't too bad either.

"<a href="http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2008/11/say-hello-to-gmail-voice-and-video-chat.html">Gmail voice and video chat</a> makes it easy to stay in touch with friends and family using your  computers microphone and speakers. But until now, this required both  people to be at their computers, signed into Gmail at the same time.  Given that most of us dont spend all day in front of our computers, we  thought, wouldnt it be nice if you could call people directly on their  phones?

Starting today, you can call any phone right from Gmail."

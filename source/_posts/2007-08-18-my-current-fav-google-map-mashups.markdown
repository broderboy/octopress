These are some sites I've found since people have started making Google Map Mashups either because they are really cool or I use them a lot.<br /><br />

<a href="http://www.bittrees.com/diggmap/">DiggMap</a> - Diggs are shown in real-time on the map for users that have specified their location in their profile. <br /><br />

<a href="http://www.wotton.org/map/batchgeo.html">Google Maps Batch Geocoder</a><br /><br />

<a href="http://www.google.com/maps/ms?msa=0&msid=112255436550398488662.00000111d25a08716efa7">Google Offices</a> - Shows Google Offices around the world<br /><br />

<a href="http://traffic.poly9.com/">Traffic and Weather Maps</a> - Mashes Traffic conditions, road closings, construction, and weather.  Not too useful to me as I don't have a car anymore but it was when I did ;)<br /><br />

<a href="http://map.talleye.com/">Walk in a straight line around the world!</a> - Pick a spot on the map, then the direction you want to walk in, and the map will show you all the places you would hit if you walked around the world!<br /><br />

<a href="http://www.gypsymaps.com/">GypsyMaps</a> - My all time favorite.  Gives Directions with the NYC subway system.  I like it a lot better then <a href="http://www.hopstop.com">hopstop</a>, it just seems more responsive<br /><br />

<a href="http://www.walkscore.com">Walk Score</a> - Put in where you live and find all the walkable places near you.  Great for living in a City and you don't have a car.<br /><br />

<a href="http://www.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/index.html">Google Maps API</a> - Not a map, but the starting resource for if you want to make a mashup<br /><br />

<a href="http://gmaps-samples.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/spreadsheetsmapwizard/makecustommap.htm">Google Maps with a spreadsheet</a> - Power a Google map from<br /><br />

<a href="http://streetviewr.com/">StreetViewr</a> - A collection of funny, interesting, random photos that people have found with <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&ie=UTF8&ll=37.09024,-95.712891&spn=47.167389,92.8125&z=4&om=1&layer=c&utm_campaign=en&utm_source=en-ha-na-us-google-svn&utm_medium=ha">Google Street View</a><br /><br />

<a href="http://the-edu-map.com/">The EDU Map</a> - See places of education for a given city<br /><br />

<a href="http://www.walkjogrun.net/">Walk Jog Run</a> - Share routes with other runner's.  I've found some new, less boring ones using this =)

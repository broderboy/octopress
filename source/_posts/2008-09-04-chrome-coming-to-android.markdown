<a href="http://androidcommunity.com/google-chrome-coming-to-android-20080903/">Android Community</a> and a few other blogs have stated that Chrome will be making its way to android, but aside from the processing stack and improved javascriptability (yes I just made up a word), is it really going to be the full chrome app everyone is playing with or just a tweaked out webkit (which we already knew was going to be the native Android browser)

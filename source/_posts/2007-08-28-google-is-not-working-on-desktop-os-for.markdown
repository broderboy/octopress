This is really just a quick response to <a href="http://digg.com/linux_unix/Google_is_preparing_its_own_distribution_of_Linux">this</a> Digg.  How it made the front page is completely beyond my comprehension.  The article itself is a year old and Google has denied countless times they are going to release "Goobuntu".  Heck, I've been to a tech talk where its been stated that Goobuntu is just their internal OS that developers can use that comes with some snazzy Google tools.  See below for some other confirmations that Goobuntu isn't coming out.

I'm going to add to this list but I really need some dinner....
<br /><br />
Goobuntu is on every one's most wanted list from Google, Heck I'd rather have that then the gPhone... maybe... but as of right now, I'll have to wait forever....

<a href="http://googledataapis.blogspot.com/2007/07/create-calendars-with-google-calendar.html">Google Calendar API</a> posts new read and write features.  They have added:<br /><br />
- <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/calendar/developers_guide_protocol.html#ManagingCalendars">owncalendars</a>: contains the collection of calendars that a user 'owns' <br />
- <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/calendar/developers_guide_protocol.html#ManagingSubscriptions">allcalendars</a>: contains all the calendars that a user has access to<br /><br />

Usefull for listing all your calendars if you manage a lot of them, or changing their settings all at once (both features have read and write capabilities)

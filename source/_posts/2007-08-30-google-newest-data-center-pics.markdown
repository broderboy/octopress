<a href="http://www.informationweek.com/galleries/showImage.jhtml?galleryID=62">Information Week</a> posted some photos of Google's newest data center near The Dalles' dam.  Needless to say, I wouldn't mind access to this baby.  Heck, I would want one, but there is no way I would be able to power it.  I'm sure the proximity to the dam's power station and water supply were key factors in choosing the location.

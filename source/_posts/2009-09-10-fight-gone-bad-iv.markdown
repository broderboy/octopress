<a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/timbroder/~3/PDBIQvyH3rY/">Fight Gone Bad IV</a>: "<p>On Sept 26th I am competing in Fight Gone Bad IV to raise money for Wounded Warriors and Athletes for a cure. Fight gone bad is a CrossFit workout scored by the number of reps.</p>
<p>Description from the <a href="http://www.crossfit.com/cf-info/faq.html#WOD2">CrossFit website</a></p>
<dl>
<dt><strong><a name="WOD2">4.3. Explain Fight Gone Bad</a></strong></dt>
<dd>In this workout you move from each of five stations after a minute. This is a five-minute round from which a one-minute break is allowed before repeating. Weve used this in 3 and 5 round versions. The stations are:
<ol>
<li>Wall-ball: 20 pound ball, 10 ft target. (Reps)</li>
<li>Sumo deadlift high-pull: 75 pounds (Reps)</li>
<li>Box Jump: 20? box (Reps)</li>
<li>Push-press: 75 pounds (Reps)</li>
<li>Row: calories (Calories)</li>
</ol>
<p>The clock does not reset or stop between exercises. On call of rotate, the athlete/s must move to next station immediately for good score. One point is given for each rep, except on the rower where each calorie is one point.</p>

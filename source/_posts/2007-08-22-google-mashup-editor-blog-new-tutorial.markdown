The guys over on the Mashup team have posted a <a href="http://code.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=74728&topic=12044">new tutorial</a> on how to use the Google Mashup Editor to mash Picasa Web Albums with a Google Map.  The example is <a href="http://levsplaces.googlemashups.com/">here</a>.  I started working on my own but I haven't really played with the GME before.  Hopefully I'll have that tomorrow.

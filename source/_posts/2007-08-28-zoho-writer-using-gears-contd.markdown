In a quick follow-up to my <a href="http://blog.gpowered.net/2007/08/google-get-in-gear.html">previous article</a>; Google <a href="http://google-code-updates.blogspot.com/2007/08/weekly-google-code-roundup-reaching-sky.html">code blog</a> posted a <a href="http://gearsblog.blogspot.com/2007/08/gearing-up-with-zoho-offline.html">video talk</a> about the experience the Zoho team had in incorporating Gears with their Writer.<br /><br />


I hate to bring it up again, but like I said before, the Docs team better get moving... a Google product competitor using Google Gears first?

Google Gadgets can now be added to your calendar.  Previously the only gadgets I had on my calendar were Google Doodles, Weather, phases of the moon, and PicasaWeb Photo of the day.  Now just about anything is going to be possible.  I briefly played around with it this morning and added horoscopes and Sudoku to my calendar.<br /><br />

Other new gadgets include Movie Release dates and famous people's birthdays.  I expect that very soon there will be video game releases as well.  <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/calendar/calendar_gadgets.html">Documentation</a> is out for the gadgets, so get coding!

The Android developer's challenge has release most of the top 50 (a few opted to not be made public for now).  A slide deck of the winners is available <a href="http://code.google.com/android/images/adc1r1_deck.pdf">here</a>.  I've gone through some of them and they have been blowing me away. <a href="http://www.talkandroid.com/92-developer-challenge-top-50-android-application/">Lists</a> are being put together with the websites for the winners.  There is some really exciting work being done.

<br /><br />Even though its the first one on the list, AndroidScan still blows me away.  It uses the phone on the camera to take a photo of a bar code, look up the product in a database, and then gets you all the information you would need about that product and where you can buy it right from your phone (amazon, ebay, etc).  Do yourself a favor and watch the <a href="http://scan.jsharkey.org/">video</a>.  <br /><br /><img src="http://scan.jsharkey.org/vlcsnap-7082040.png.jpg"/><br /><br />

I'll be going through that slide deck and will be posting some more of my favorites. Anyone else hope the HTC Diamond can run Android out of the box? ;)

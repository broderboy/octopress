<blockquote><em>Welcome to the future of killing time on the internet, and  getting paid for it: Digg is implementing a reverse pay wall! We believe  this will greatly enhance the Digg experience. Early reaction from test  users has been great. Can Duruk, developer at Digg, sums it up well:</em>

<em>"I thought Rebecca Black's 'Friday' video was great now that I got paid to watch it!"</em></blockquote>
Now, I used to be on Digg for at least an hour a day. then v4 came... and it kind of sucks now..... Losing nested categories was a huge loss for me.

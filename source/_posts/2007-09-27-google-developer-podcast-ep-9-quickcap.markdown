I got some time today to listen to this Podcast today on the way to and from one of our other buildings today uptown.  I was attending <a href="http://www.sas.com">SAS</a> training which is a pretty cool data mining / report generation tool.
<br /><br />
This episode was an interview with T.V. Raman and his seeing eye dog Hubbell on accessibility in a developer's world.  Quick recap:<br /><br />

<ul><li>Why care about accessibility? (As a developer)<br />
<ul><li>You DON'T know your user</li>
<li>try to build for the widest range of abilities</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Think about how people with different abilities will use the app</li>
<li>FireFox, Internet Explorer, Safari, Konquerer.  Browser specifics are a problem</li>
<li>Generic browsers out of the box do not help vision, does not enhance views, or help the motion impaired</li>
<li>you have to add on to the browser</li>
<li>There is too much "slop", you need to take a step back and not assume what your user will use</li>
<li>CSS is good for getting developer / user balance</li>
<li>There are very good FireFox accessibility addons</li>
<li>Google results page is an html mess so it can work in all browsers</li>
<li>The standard GMail interface is an accessibility nightmare but this is remedied by using the mobile version</li>
<li>A year from now Ajax accessibility will get much better with FireFox 3</li>
<li><b>Bottom Lines:</b>
<ul><li>What is it that you are using for accessibility? Is it the base platform? Does it come with tools</li>
<li>What is the focus?</li>
<li>What platform are you on?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Google books scan and OCR to voice is decent</li>
<li>The mobile calendar is also good.</li> 
</ul>

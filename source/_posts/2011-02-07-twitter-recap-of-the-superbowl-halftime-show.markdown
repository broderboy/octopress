<p>Ok so, the superbowl halftime was just god awful </p>
<p>@tomkaters I just put Prince on the turntable. #MakeMyOwnHalftimeShow</p>
<p>@cskilpatrick This halftime show needs more Bieber. #superbowl</p>
<p> @CobraCommander Who is this tranny singer butchering Guns at halftime?</p>
<p> @iamunscared Fergie is a train wreck, just ruined G n R.</p>
<p> @amyasparklethe sound from the halftime show is completely messed up. awful. </p>
<p> @garyvee No more pls</p>
<p> @tomkaters Enjoy halftime by tom. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bP48M2BEs0 </p>
<p> @cskilpatrick They should play this halftime show when they're trying to get cultists to leave their compound. #superbowl</p>
<p> @brianshaler Glad everyone already tweeted about all the flaws in the Super Bowl halftime show. Now I don't have to.</p>
<p> @garyvee It's time for a new format for superbowl halftime shows, how about interviews at the 50 yrd line ...conan and Jon Stewart interview Prince</p>
<p> @brianshaler My favorite part of the halftime show was when they played the song "Where is the Lol? E"</p>

 @werty Pretty sure Fergie raided Ace Frehley's closet for her Super Bowl halftime show costume. #superbowl #blackeyedpeas

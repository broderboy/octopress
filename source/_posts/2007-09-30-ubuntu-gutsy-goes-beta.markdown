Ubuntu Gutsy Gibbon has gone beta and is on track for its October 18th Release.  So, if you haven't been using it since tribe 2 like me, and want to upgrade from Fiesty Fawn, follow the below steps.
<br /><br />

<ol>
<li>Open a terminal.</li>
<li>Type <i>sudo update-manager -d</i></li>
<li>Follow the instructions</li>
</ol>
More information about upgrading can be found <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GutsyUpgrades">here</a><br /><br />

If you want to upgrade from a cd or do a fresh install, ISOs are available <a href="http://releases.ubuntu.com/releases/7.10/">here</a>

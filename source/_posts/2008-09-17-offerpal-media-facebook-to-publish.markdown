Things have changed slightly since I <a href="http://blog.gpowered.net/2008/05/why-microsoft-will-buy-facebook-and.html">last</a> wrote about this, but for the better.  Look like Google will be able to trawl some of Facebook <a href="http://www.insidefacebook.com/2008/09/12/facebook-to-publish-event-directory-for-search-engines/">after all</a>.<br /><br />
Searchable data will include People, Pages, Applications, Events, and Groups.

Got a new blackberry at work today: The <a href="http://www.blackberry8800series.com/blackberry8820/">8820</a>.  Much nicer then my old <a href="http://na.blackberry.com/eng/devices/device-detail.jsp?navId=H0,C63,P65">clunker</a> which... err... broke... yeah we'll go with broke.  Getting the curve when it comes out on Friday for Verizon.  I can't install any applications on my work one, but as soon as I get my personal one, Google Blackberry app reviews will be pouring out =)
